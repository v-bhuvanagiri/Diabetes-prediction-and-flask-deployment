## Overview

The project uses a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on input features like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc. The model is then deployed as a Flask web application, enabling users to interact with the model through a simple web interface.

## Features

- Machine learning-based diabetes prediction.
- User-friendly web interface.
- Input validation for medical data.
- Real-time prediction results.

## Getting Started

### Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open the web application in your browser (default: http://localhost:5000).

3. Input the necessary medical data for diabetes prediction.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model is based on [algorithm/library]. For more details on the model and how it was trained, refer to [model folder/link].

## Flask Web Application

The Flask web application provides an interface for users to input their medical data and get predictions for diabetes likelihood.
